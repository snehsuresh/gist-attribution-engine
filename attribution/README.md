# Phase 3: Attribution Engine (Ablation-Based)

This document provides an in-depth explanation of **Phase 3: Ablation-Based Attribution**, part of the Gist Attribution Engine. This phase is responsible for measuring the influence of individual document **chunks** (paragraphs) on an LLM-generated response, and then rolling up those scores to **document-level** influence. The goal is to go beyond traditional retrieval similarity and apply a **causal method** to score what content truly affected the model's output.

---

## Purpose

> "If we removed this chunk from the context, would the LLM’s response change?"

This phase answers that question using an **ablation loop** — where we remove one chunk at a time, rerun the LLM, and measure the change in its output.

It enables:

- Fine-grained content attribution
- Human-aligned crediting logic
- Potential for licensing & feedback systems

---

## Files Involved

### `attribution/`

- `run_ablation.py` — Main execution script
- `ablation_utils.py` — Embedding, prompt building, drift scoring
- `cache_manager.py` — LLM and embedding result caching
- `attribution_schema.sql` — SQL schema for storing output (optional)

### `data/`

- `processed/embeddings/embeddings.npy` — Vectorized chunk embeddings
- `processed/embeddings/metadata.pkl` — Metadata (chunk_id, article_id, text, etc.)
- `processed/output/attribution_results/*.json` — Output files with scores

---

## How It Works (Overview)

1. **User query** is embedded
2. **Top-K chunks** are retrieved using FAISS
3. Full context is sent to LLM → generates response
4. Each chunk is **ablated** (removed one at a time)
5. New responses are compared using **cosine drift**
6. Influence scores are computed per chunk
7. Scores are **normalized and rolled up** to document level
8. Output saved as `.json` or optionally inserted into DuckDB

---

## `run_ablation.py`

### Command-line usage:

```bash
python attribution/run_ablation.py \
  --query "Why is inflation rising?" \
  --embeddings_path data/processed/embeddings/embeddings.npy \
  --metadata_path data/processed/embeddings/metadata.pkl \
  --top_k 5 \
  --scoring_mode drift
```

### What it does:

- Loads Top-K most relevant chunks using FAISS
- Sends a full prompt to OpenAI's GPT model
- For each chunk, creates a new prompt without that chunk
- Calculates embedding drift: `1 - cosine_similarity(full, ablated)`
- Normalizes and rolls up chunk scores to document-level
- Writes final attribution result to JSON

---

## `ablation_utils.py`

### `embed_text(text)`
Uses SentenceTransformer (MiniLM) to generate a normalized embedding for a given string.

### `build_full_prompt(query, chunks)`
Creates the base prompt with all chunks included:

```text
You are answering a user question using only relevant context below.
Ignore unrelated or unhelpful text.

Question: {query}

Context:
- chunk 1
- chunk 2
...
```

### `build_ablated_prompt(query, chunks, omit_index)`
Same as above, but omits one chunk. This forms the core of the ablation.

### `cosine_drift(e_full, e_ablated)`
Computes drift = `1 - cosine_similarity()` between full and ablated embeddings.

### `rollup_to_documents(chunk_scores, chunk_to_article)`
Groups chunk scores by `article_id` and normalizes them to compute document-level attribution.

### `compute_combined_score()` (NEW)
Supports three scoring modes:
- `drift`: Pure cosine drift (semantic)
- `drift_faiss`: Drift × FAISS score (weighted by retrieval strength)
- `drift_overlap`: Drift + token-level Jaccard overlap (bonus for lexical match)

---

## `cache_manager.py`

Avoids repeated LLM and embedding calls by caching them on disk.
- Uses SHA256 of the prompt as filename
- Stores both LLM response and its embedding vector

---

## Drift Thresholding

Chunks with very low drift (< `0.05`) are considered noise and given zero influence:

```python
if drift < 0.05:
    drift = 0.0
```

This reduces false attribution to irrelevant paragraphs.

---

## Evaluation of Scoring Modes

We tested the following query using all three scoring modes:

> **Query:** How has Elon Musk influenced U.S. policy and public opinion during Trump’s second term, especially around the Ukraine war and online disinformation?

### Chunk Influence Comparison

| Chunk ID                        | Drift   | Drift × FAISS | Drift + Overlap |
|--------------------------------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| lewrockwell_2025-07-14_21_0    | 0.276   | 0.351          | 0.260            |
| counterpunch_2025-06-04_36_2   | 0.135   | 0.158          | 0.130            |
| lewrockwell_2025-07-14_21_1    | 0.451   | 0.382          | 0.479            |
| counterpunch_2025-06-04_36_0   | 0.137   | 0.108          | 0.127            |
| lewrockwell_2025-07-14_21_3    | 0.000   | 0.000          | 0.003            |

### Interpretation

In this query, `drift` produced the most stable and intuitive attributions:
- It ranked the most semantically aligned chunk (`21_1`) highest.
- It did not overvalue chunks with token overlap or FAISS noise.

In contrast:
- `drift_faiss` **dampened** the top drift chunk due to a slightly lower FAISS score.
- `drift_overlap` **boosted** chunks with keyword matches but lower true influence.

### Why Drift Alone Wins

- Better aligned with actual meaning change in LLM responses
- Less sensitive to retrieval artifacts
- More consistent across topics, especially for reasoning-type questions

Hence, **we recommend `drift` as the default attribution mode**.

| Semantic Drift Scoring  | ✅ Cosine delta | ❌ Retrieval similarity only |
| Chunk-level Attribution | ✅              | ❌                           |
| Document Roll-up        | ✅              | ✅ (document-level only)     |
| Caching                 | ✅ Prompt-based | ❓                           |

## Business Impact

- More honest attribution = better trust and explainability
- Ability to trace output to specific claims, not just documents
- Can support licensing, feedback, content flagging, and summarization
- Enables future monetization by showing influence weight per source

---

## Next Steps

- Add entity-level influence scoring
- Add visual UI overlays per chunk
- Add token-level or sentence-level ablation

Let me know if you'd like the UI or scoring engine connected to this module.
